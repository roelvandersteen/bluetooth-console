# Bluetooth Console

Console Program to Switch Bluetooth Radio On or Off

The program uses WinRT from a .NET Framework Console App, and can be considered a sample application that demonstrates this technique.

Usage:

```cmd
  bluetooth.exe on
  bluetooth.exe off
  :: This will toggle the current state of the Bluetooth radio:
  bluetooth.exe
```
